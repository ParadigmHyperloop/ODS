# OpenLoop Data Shuttle

_All the Telemetry_

This service runs at the Control Point and is the direct recipient of all
telemetry data from all PODs on the PODNET

# Overview

The ODS is a required service to operate the OpenLoop Pod. Without a valid
telemetry server connection, the OpenLoop Pod will refuse to proceed to a
Post-boot stage.  See
[hyperloop-core](https://github.com/openloopalliance/hyperloop-core).

# Setup and Usage

## Prerequisites

* A sane python 2.7 environment.
* InfluxDB
* Grafana

## Running

If you have Influxdb running on your localhost and the pod is on the same
network as your computer, then you can just run `./server.py`.  Otherwise,
use the following arguments to tell the ODS server where you have InfluxDB
running so that it can dump the incoming telemetry data.

```
$ ./server.py --help
usage: server.py [-h] [-v] [-p PORT] [-d DIRECTORY]
                 [--influx-host INFLUX_HOST] [--influx-port INFLUX_PORT]
                 [--influx-user INFLUX_USER] [--influx-pass INFLUX_PASS]
                 [--influx-name INFLUX_NAME]

OpenLoop Data Shuttle

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Server listen port
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        directory to store raw log and data files in
  --influx-host INFLUX_HOST
                        Influxdb hostname
  --influx-port INFLUX_PORT
                        Influxdb port
  --influx-user INFLUX_USER
                        Influxdb username
  --influx-pass INFLUX_PASS
                        Influxdb password
  --influx-name INFLUX_NAME
                        Influxdb database name
```
